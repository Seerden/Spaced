## Spaced

Complete refactor of my spaced-repetition learning application, [Mana](https://github.com/seerden/mana).

### Why?

Mana was one of my first fully self-guided full-stack projects. I still find I could use its functionality in my daily life, but refactoring the code in-place is too large of an effort (especially considering I want to migrate the database from MongoDB to PostgreSQL), so instead I'm just restarting the project from scratch.
